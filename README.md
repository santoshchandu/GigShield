# GigShield  AI Powered Parametric Income Insurance for Food Delivery Partners


## Problem Statement

India's food delivery partners (Zomato, Swiggy) lose **20–30% of monthly income** during extreme weather, pollution, curfews, and natural disasters. They have **no financial safety net** when disruptions happen, they bear the full loss alone.

**GigShield** solves this with a parametric insurance platform that:
- Monitors disruptions in real time
- Automatically triggers claims (zero paperwork)
- Instantly pays out lost income to the worker's UPI account

## Persona: Food Delivery Partner (Zomato / Swiggy)

### Who They Are
- Age: 20–35 | City based | 2 wheeler rider
- Works 8–10 hours/day, 6 days/week
- Earns ₹500–₹1,200/day (₹3,000–₹8,400/week)
- Highly dependent on daily earnings for rent, food, EMIs
- Low digital literacy needs a simple, Regional language friendly app

### Persona Scenarios

#### Scenario 1 Ramesh, Mumbai (Monsoon Disruption)
> Ramesh has been delivering for Swiggy for 2 years. One Tuesday in July, Mumbai receives 180mm of rainfall in 6 hours. Zomato suspends operations. Ramesh cannot work for 9 hours, losing ~₹700. With GigShield, the system detects rainfall > 15mm/hr in his pincode, auto-triggers a claim, and ₹600 is credited to his UPI within 10 minutes. He never had to open the app.

#### Scenario 2 Arjun, Delhi (Pollution Shutdown)
> Delhi's AQI crosses 400 (Severe+). The local authority issues an advisory halting outdoor work for 2 days. Arjun loses ₹1,400. GigShield detects the AQI threshold breach, cross-validates with his active policy zone, and processes a 2-day payout automatically.

#### Scenario 3 Priya, Bangalore (Local Bandh)
> A sudden unplanned bandh is declared in Priya's delivery zone. She cannot access the restaurant pickup areas. GigShield's social disruption trigger (fed by a verified news/government API) flags the event and issues a zone specific payout for the affected hours.

## Weekly Premium Model

### How It Works
Premiums are charged **every Monday** via UPI auto debit. Coverage runs Monday 00:00 → Sunday 23:59.

### Premium Calculation Formula

```
Base Premium = ₹49/week (standard coverage)

Adjustments:
  + Zone Risk Multiplier     (0.8x – 1.4x based on flood/heat history)
  + Income Bracket Modifier  (higher earners pay slightly more for proportional coverage)
  - Loyalty Discount         (–₹2/week after 12 consecutive weeks)
  - Low-Risk Zone Discount   (–₹3/week for historically safe zones)

Final Weekly Premium Range: ₹29 – ₹99/week
```

### Coverage Tiers

| Tier | Weekly Premium | Max Weekly Payout | Disruptions Covered |
|------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Basic Shield | ₹29 | ₹500 | Rain, Heat |
| Full Shield | ₹59 | ₹1,200 | Rain, Heat, AQI, Curfew |
| Pro Shield | ₹99 | ₹2,500 | All triggers + extended hours |

### What Is Covered (Income Loss ONLY)
✅ Lost delivery hours due to extreme rain (>15mm/hr)

✅ Lost income during extreme heat advisory (>43°C)

✅ Work stoppage due to severe AQI (>300)

✅ Income loss from verified curfews/bandhs in delivery zone

### What Is NOT Covered
❌ Vehicle repairs or damage

❌ Health or accident expenses

❌ Life insurance

❌ Income loss due to personal reasons

## Parametric Triggers

| Trigger ID | Event | Data Source | Threshold | Payout |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| T1 | Heavy Rain | OpenWeatherMap API | Rainfall > 15mm/hr | ₹75/hr lost |
| T2 | Extreme Heat | OpenWeatherMap API | Temp > 43°C for 3+ hrs | ₹60/hr lost |
| T3 | Severe Pollution | OpenAQ API | AQI > 300 | ₹70/hr lost |
| T4 | Curfew/Bandh | Mock Govt. Alert API | Zone flagged active | ₹80/hr lost |
| T5 | Flash Flood | IMD Mock API | Flood alert Level 2+ | ₹90/hr lost |

## AI/ML Integration Plan

### 1. Dynamic Premium Calculator (scikit learn)
- **Model**: Gradient Boosted Regressor
- **Inputs**: Zone lat/lng, historical disruption count, avg weekly income, season, worker tenure
- **Output**: Personalized weekly premium in ₹
- **Training Data**: Synthetic dataset of 10,000 worker profiles + historical weather data

### 2. Fraud Detection Engine (Rule Based + ML Hybrid)
- **GPS Validation**: Worker's last known location must be within disruption zone
- **Platform Cross Check**: If Zomato API shows active orders during claimed disruption → flag
- **Anomaly Score**: ML model flags workers with claim frequency > 2 std deviations above mean
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Claim deduplication by worker ID + event ID + date

### 3. Predictive Risk Modeling
- Weekly forecast of likely disruption events per zone
- Helps insurer pre-provision payout reserves
- Shown on Admin dashboard as "Next Week Risk Forecast"

---

## Platform Choice: Web (PWA)

**Why Web over Native Mobile?**
- Workers use low end Android phones PWA works without Play Store install
- Reduced friction for onboarding (share a link, not an APK)
- Admin dashboard works on desktop browsers for insurers
- Single codebase for both worker and admin portals
